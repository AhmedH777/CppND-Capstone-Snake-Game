# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Project AddOn
In this project I added a food class to the project which handle special types of food which give different scores based on the type:

Normal Food      : Yellow color : 1 score point.

Booster Food     : BLue color   : 2 score points.

MegaBooster Food : REd color    : 3 score points.



## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Project Rubric points addressed

1. The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures. [food.cpp].

2. The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.                           [Food class in food.cpp and food.hpp].

3. Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.                       [Food class in food.cpp and food.hpp].

4. Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.                     [Food class in food.cpp and food.hpp].

5. Classes encapsulate behavior.                                                      [Food class in food.cpp and food.hpp].

6. The project makes use of references in function declarations.                      [void Food::placeFood(Snake &snake)].

7. The project follows the Rule of 5.                                                 [Food class in food.cpp and food.hpp].
